# copilot-agent-testing-demo
Contains God function that can do anything

# Code smells Demonstrated
- **God class**: Single class that handles LDAP, SQL, validation, Parsing ...etc.
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Passwords, API keys and connection string in plain text.
- **SQL Injection**: Direct string concatenation in queries.
- **Very Long methods**: The **Process_everything** method does too many things.
- **Poor Encapsulation**: Public Access to sensitive data.

# Goal
Please using copilot to resolve issues.
